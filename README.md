# fs-flashcard-app

Start of a Quizlet inspired app.

- Users should be able to create an account and log in, create a flashcard set with words and attach audio. Users should be able to create edit and delete flashcard sets.
- The flashcard shown on screen is only a card that flips , the front of it should be the definition and the back should be the concept that needs to be learned, for foreign language learning, if we are learning spanish from english front card should say Apple and the back card should say Manzana and an audio we can play for the audio of the word. Under the card we have 2 buttons back and forward that iterates through all the cards we the user has created in this set.
- Flashcard should be minimally styled using Tailwind
- Implement spaced repetition (use supermemo for now)
